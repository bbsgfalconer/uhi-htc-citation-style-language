## Status
[Alpha release](https://github.com/bbsgfalconer/uhi-htc-citation-style-language/releases/tag/0.1.0) ready for evaluation.

## Usage
This CSL is for use with reference manager tools such as [RefWorks](https://refworks.proquest.com/about-us/), [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/), etc.

To get the best results with this CSL, adopt the following practices when adding entries to your reference manager of choice:
* **ALWAYS** enter a 'title' and a 'short title' for reference items. The 'title' will be used in the footnote for the first citation of a reference, then the 'short title' will be used for all subequent citation footnotes.
* Enter article or book titles in sentence case, not title case. E.g. prefer "God has spoken: a history of christian theology" over "God has Spoken, a History of Christian Theology".
* Do not enter full stops at the end of titles or names in the reference tool. E.g. "Theological reflections" and not "Theological reflections.".

Use the reference manager to insert citations and a bibliography into your paper. Set the referencing style to 'University of the Highlands and Islands, Highland Theological College 2020 edition (short-title)' and voil√°: well-formatted references.

Included in this repository is a copy of the HTC referencing guide from the [HTC handbook](https://www.htc.uhi.ac.uk/t4-media/one-web/htc/students-and-staff/HTC_Referencing_Guide.pdf), formatted using this CSL via [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), with references inserted from [this sample reference library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2555595/uhi_highland_theological_college_csl_development).
